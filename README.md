## Hosting
If you'd like to host this bot you can create a `config.py` file in the root directory with the structure down below. If you don't want backups of the database you can set enable_backups as False
```python
# Discord bot config
discord_bot_token: str = ""  # Your bot's discord token

# Google drive config
enable_backups: bool = False  # Whether to enable google drive backups every 24h | REQUIRES A SERVICE ACCOUNT
service_account_file_path: str = "service_account_key.json"  # Path of the .json file containing the service account key file
backups_folder_id: str = ""  # ID of your google drive backups folder. Make sure that the service account can see it
backups_frequency_hours: int = 24  # How often to perform backups.
```
